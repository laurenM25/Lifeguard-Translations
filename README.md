# Lifeguard-Translations

#### note:
This is a work in progress. I began this project summer of 2024, inspired by my experiences lifeguarding at a pool with many spanish-speaking guests. I hope to bit-by-bit make this site a hub for essential vocabulary needed to communicate with pool patrons.

### current features:
Using merriam webster's spanish-english dictionary api and a google translate api, I provide translations and basic dictionary information for a user request. Sentences translated from english into spanish come with a pop up dictionary feature when the user hovers over each word of the sentence. 

All drawn graphics are designed by me using procreate.

### next steps:
My current set-up utilizes the meta id, functional label, and short definition of each dictionary entry. When obtaining dictionary entries for the user's query, results are obtained if the query word is found in either the meta id or a stem. To make results more streamlined, I may look to incorporate a method to better search through dictionary entries and see if it is relevant enough to the query.

In the future, I will enhance the design of the site, including more graphics. I will also establish a catalogue of essential vocabulary and phrases that lifeguards can refer to.
